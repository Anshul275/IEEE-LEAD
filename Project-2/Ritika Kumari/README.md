## Description
The window is a simple gui creation. Initially it asks for a input for the product to be searched. Then it opens the first google url. The followed by the first flipkart result. For the flipkart result it asks for the type of product entered-'Electronics', 'Clothing and Footwear and Books', 'Toys and More'.It then displays the first 7 amazon results and asks for which result we want to compare.
## Unique
Implementing gui makes it user-friendly. Also buttons at all steps makes it a smooth process. It displays the first 7 results from Amazon providing more options.
## Problems Faced
Got confused at many places. Creating the perfect design/orientation was the most difficult part for me. Sometimes, it was difficult to identity why a certain function was not giving the desired output. Google and mentors played their role here. 
## Scope of improvement
I couldn't display pictures so would like to do that. Also the window is too packed and the design is weird. Adding a scrollbar would make it more spacious and making a better design. Also adding more websites, reviews etc would be the next aim.
## What you learned?
It was a nice experience overall. This project definately made me more patient for dealing with errors.
