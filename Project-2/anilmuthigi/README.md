  Description:

The project involves web-scrapping the prices and details of a product from the two popular e-commerce websites, Amazon and Flipkart.The program consists of a search box in which people can search for a product and can compare the prices of a product in Amazon and Flipkart. After the user searches for a product, the program shows the product's name and price as shown in the website.

The project also displays google search results, the program consists of a search bar in which people can type in what they want to search, it will be searched in Google and the first result on google will be displayed with its title, brief description, a link to visit the website and a link to see all search results.
  
  
  Problems Faced:
Since this technology was new to me, understanding how it works and implementing it was a challenge.Understanding the url changes with change in the search item inorder to implement the code was also time consuming.
  
 Scope of improvement:
  1.The project could have been more interactive and user friendly .
  2.I could have used have used a better technique to filter out the best result to be      displayed onto the user for price comparison.
  3.I could have included multiple sites for searching inorder to really get the lowest possible prize.
