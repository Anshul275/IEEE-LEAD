**DESCRIPTION**

The Project consists of three separate apps based gui implemented using Tkinter. First app is the basic implementation of web scraping and searching the google for anything and displaying its First URL. Second app(Flipkart Product Search), takes an input as product's name searches it on flipkart and displays its product's name, product's price, product's link and product's image. Third app          (Product Search and Compare) takes any product name as input and searches it on amazon, flipkart and snapdeal and display's the product's name,price and link.


**UNIQUE**

Since in app2(Flipkart Search) and in app3(Product Search and Compare), the e-commerce websites such as amazon and flipkart have different structure for electronic and household products. I corrected it using if case. If you search "Redmi Note 8 Pro" or "Sandals/Surf-Excel" if you have not implemented both the structures it will throw an error denoting "Index out of range".


**PROBLEMS FACED**

Initially I got stuck in scraping the first URL from Google Search. I fixed it by watching some youtube video's and implementing it accordingly which worked fine for me. After that i didn't face any problem in scraping data. Some problems were also faced in implementing GUI using Tkinter which was also solved using Google and Youtube. A problem of adding image from flipkart to GUI was solved using Selenium.


**SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT**

The GUI can be made more attractive and interactive. Moreover some more data can also be scraped such as product's description, product's rating, offers, etc. 


**WHAT YOU LEARNED**

I learned how to scrap data from the websites using python and its various modules(beautiful soup, request, selenium) and to display it in GUI(using Tkinter). I also came to know the structures of the various websites such as Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Google.
