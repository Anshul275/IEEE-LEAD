   #### NEW.PY
     In this i have callled all the different sites through class appended the comman results that is the name ,price of the products with        the site and hence the price can be compared.
   #### GUIPAYTYM.PY
    In this i have created the gui for paytymmall and represented its data for the product entered by the user
   #### finale.py 
    prints all my milestone in the console in the form of a dataframe.
   
   #### all of this acts for the name of the product enetred by the user
    
  
### PROBLEMS FACED
* every site had a different class tags and the image source was difficult to scrape.
* my sort function is applied to three sites which i scraped while flipkart is not accepting it 
*  I have made GUI for individual sites but i could not merge them together same with CSV
* I converted all of these sites into classes but in this my tkinter is not working

### Scope of imporovement
I will make a website wherin i will directly call the class and show all the data together ,will try working out on the different layouts, add plots using matplotlib ,andd pictures.
### What I have learned 
I have learnt different packages from PYTHON ,i have learnt how to GOOGLE and how to DEBUG them accordingly .
