#### CHALLENGES FACED :

1. Smooth working of GUI was really a big challenge
2. Displaying images in Tkinter was really problematic as the widgets dont hold the image once it goes out of scope
3. The layout always becomes a challenge

#### SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT :

The GUI could have been more responsive and smooth to enhance user experience. I tried to implement multi-threading but the time was not sufficient to use that aspect effectively, so I dropped the idea for the time being.

#### LEARNING OUTCOME :

Primarily web scraping and building a GUI was the main objective and I accomplished them. I had never built a GUI and as I progressed with the project the problems kept increasing. Then I realised what it takes to build a bug-free GUI. Apart from them, there were many other small bits like requests and most importantly I learnt how to google things up and use the documentations.

#### ACKNOWLEDGEMNET -
_I am really thankful to all my club seniors to provide me this opportunity and special thanks to my mentors - ARUNESH SARKAR & VAIBHAV, for helping me._
