DESCRIPTION
The project contain a nvaigation bar which takes you to the desired section of the page and on hovering the elements thier is color changes. Then next comes different sections each of these section has headings.I have used typing animation using  javascript below my name.The project section has github project link and the links for contact section.

Problems Faced:

Navigation bar was not working as in it use to cover the whole page so I have added the header . As this was my first github project ,I faced alot of issues while configuration. Animation part took maximum time.To make the webpage responsive was fatiguing.

Scope of imporovement:

The webpage would have been more responsive.I would have placed the projects page more nicely and will add links to my projects. And will give a portal where in people will provide me email for reading my blogs and other feautres.

What I have learned:

This is my first github project , learned git and github . I learnt how to google things out I learned commiting in git.
