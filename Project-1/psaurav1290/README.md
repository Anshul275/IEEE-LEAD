#### DESCRIPTION :

I emphasized on a simple eligant looking website that is most importantly mobile-friendy. The home page contains a header and a navigation menu. The navigation menu is a slide-type for small-screen dvices. The whole page is designed keeping in mind the perspective and illusion that is created due to the foreground elements and backgund graphics collectively. From technical to non-technical intrests the page has it all. It contains the project section that redirects to some simple projects made using VanillaJS. And in the bottom there is about section and a footer containing the contacts.

####KEY FEATURES :

- Absolutely **mobile-friendly** - adjusts layout according to the screen size
- Animation of **vector graphics**
- **Loading animations** added
- All the graphics in the page are self-designed
- **Elegant** materiallistic look

#### CHALLENGES FACED :

1. Perfecting layouts was really a big challenge
2. Making the website responsive
3. Since all the animations and css are made by me, it was difficult to synchronise the timimgs

#### SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT :

The website has lots of potential. I wanted to add scroll-based effect and unwinding of skills on hovering. Also there could be more stuffs added.

#### LEARNING OUTCOME :

This was my attempt to create a responsive front end. I gainde lot of experience and got a deeper insight on the various challenges that come in the way. I got quite an exposure to vector graphics and dealt with vector animation. I also learnt to render a large variety of animation by just using CSS.
